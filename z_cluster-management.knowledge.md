## Core Concept

The MP Editorial Dashboard uses a hierarchical keyword clustering system to organize content strategy and guide editorial decisions. This system is designed to be dynamic and adjustable with AI assistance.

## Cluster Hierarchy

### Primary Themes

- **Purpose**: Top-level content organization matching the magazine's structural approach
- **Examples**: Lending, Technology, Compliance, Market Analysis, Industry Trends

### Sub-Themes
- **Definition**: Main subtopics that make up each primary category
- **Purpose**: Granular content areas within each primary theme
- **Function**: Direct mapping to specific content types and reader interests
- **Examples**: 
  - Under "Lending": Purchase Mortgages, Refinancing, Commercial Lending
  - Under "Technology": LOS Systems, CRM Platforms, AI/ML Applications

### Keywords
- **Definition**: Specific terms and phrases associated with each sub-theme
- **Purpose**: Target keywords for content creation, SEO optimization, and news monitoring
- **Function**: Direct input for Perplexity news search and content analysis

## Priority Weighting System

### Weight Scale
- **Range**: 0-100 numerical scale
- **Purpose**: Algorithmic prioritization for content discovery and creation
- **User Control**: Fully adjustable by editorial team based on strategic direction

### Weight Applications
1. **Perplexity News Search**: Higher-weighted clusters get priority in news discovery
2. **Content Gap Analysis**: Identifies under-covered high-priority areas
3. **AI Content Suggestions**: Influences article topic recommendations
4. **Editorial Planning**: Guides content calendar development

## Integration Points

### Article Analysis
- AI analysis matches article content against cluster keywords
- Results show which clusters are covered by each article
- Identifies content gaps in high-priority clusters

### News Monitoring
- Perplexity searches weighted by cluster priorities
- Discovered news mapped back to relevant clusters
- Coverage tracking across all cluster areas

## Editorial Workflow

1. **Strategic Planning**: Adjust cluster weights based on business priorities
2. **Content Discovery**: AI uses weights to prioritize news and topic suggestions
3. **Content Creation**: Writers target high-priority, under-covered clusters
4. **Performance Review**: Analyze cluster coverage and adjust weights accordingly

## Dynamic Adjustment

The system is designed to be continuously refined:
- **AI Insights**: Suggest weight adjustments based on performance data
- **Market Response**: Adapt priorities based on reader engagement
- **Competitive Analysis**: Adjust focus based on industry coverage gaps
- **Seasonal Trends**: Modify weights for time-sensitive topics

This approach ensures that editorial efforts are strategically aligned while remaining flexible enough to respond to market dynamics and reader interests.
